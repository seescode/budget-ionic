-lazy load the routes.

-Figure out how to make ionic push state work with ngrx
  https://github.com/seescode/ionic3-firebase-ngrx/blob/master/src/pages/tasks/tasks.ts
  -I don't think this handles time traveling since side effects don't run during 
  ui updates. 

  
-Copy over ngrx code
  -create store folder 
  -Move effects from a single folder into each of the reducer folders 
  -Have separate selectors folder.  Right now all selectors are in a single folder. 
  Modify it so that it's in multiple files.  

-Be able to create a new budget and then have it update the list of budgets 
  -when clicking the + it should open a modal from the bottom. 
-Be able to add a transaction which will then update the category results 

-Research how to persist your data with:
  navigator.storage.requestPersistent

-create an offline page
-create your unique logo 
-create multiple sizes for you logo and include them in your manifest.json
-setup remote chrome debugging for your phone.
